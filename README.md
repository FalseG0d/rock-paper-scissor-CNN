# rock-paper-scissor-CNN

CNN Model for detecting hand gesture using rock-paper-scissors dataset.
Because the dataset contains only hands with green background, it tends to overfit when predicting different photo (non green background).
Overall it gets 97% accuracy with just around 10 minutes training in google colab.
